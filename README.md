This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

This app is intended to give the current weather conditions at a given bike park using the OpenWeatherAPI. Each bike park link will route to a page highliting that parks features and the current weather conditions, temperature and humidity. 

No special requirements to use this app. Simply enter a city or state and a country or choose the bike park of your choice.
NOTE: ONLY THE FIRST 4 PARKS WILL WORK TO SATISFY ROUTING PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
